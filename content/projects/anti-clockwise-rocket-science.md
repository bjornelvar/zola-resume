### Description

[Anti-Clockwise Rocket Science](https://bjornelvar.itch.io/anti-clockwise-rocket-science-2?secret=1ncTbgCp2wtRKMwuPlaZhDNjb4) is what is best described as a 1 player ping pong game. The objective is to keep hitting the ball, bouncing it back and forth between yourself or your friendly UFO. This game was created in the first week of the 3-week course Computer Game Design and Development at Reykjavik University.

I wanted to make this game as zen as possible and I believe I achieved that. I wanted the game to never increase in difficulty, but rather to be a relaxing experience completed by the background music and sound effects.
