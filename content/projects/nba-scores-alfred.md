### Description
One evening, my partner asked me what games were on tonight and I instinctively went to type `nba` in Alfred. I of course didn't have any workflow for it, so I decided to build one myself. I used the [NBA API](https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/) to get the data and then built a workflow around it using Python. And *a lot* of JSON parsing.

If you're interested in that kind of stuff, you can check out my [Github repository](https://github.com/bjornelvar/alfred_nba_scores).

### How to use it:
* An Alfred Powerpack is required. (Sorry)
* Download the workflow from [Alfred Gallery](https://alfred.app/workflows/bjornelvar/nba-scores/).
* Double click it to install.
* Type `nba` in Alfred.
* Press enter or use the built-in hotkey on a game to see the box score or summary.
