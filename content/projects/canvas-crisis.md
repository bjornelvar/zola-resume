### Description

[Canvas Crisis](https://bjornelvar.itch.io/canvas-crisis?secret=nalHXxorpAvtMxefb4dOVO4unG4) is a 2D game created in Unity. It is a platformer where you can paint the world to your liking to solve the levels. You can paint the platforms and the tiles around you to make the player jump higher, climb up walls or just go faster. The game was designed and programmed in 2 weeks.

This game was part of the 3-week course Computer Game Design and Development at Reykjavik University. The course was taught by Steingerður Lóa and our group was invited to present our game and to represent Reykjavik University at the UT Messan event in Reykjavik.
